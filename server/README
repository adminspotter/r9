README for the base-level server parts

server.[ch]:  These are the files which contain main and some of the
setup and cleanup functions, notably for daemonhood, logging, and
listening sockets.

config.[ch]:  Configuration file parsing routines and data structures.

connect.[ch]:  These are the files which contain some abstraction
routines, so that TCP and UDP servers act about the same as far as the
connection loop calls are concerned.

signals.[ch]:  Signal-handling routines.

subserver.[ch]:  The client-connection portion of the TCP-based server
program.  Maintains an open connection to the main server and to each
client.
