This is a description of the objects and general contents of the
base-level server files.

server.cc, server.h:  The main routine, and most of the setup/cleanup
routines for the large subsections of the server program.

config_data (config.cc, config.h):  Configuration parsing class,
including both command-line options, and configuration file parsing.

Log (log.cc, log.h):  A streambuf implementation, to enable the
standard C++ std::clog object to log to syslog, rather than just
stdout.

signals.cc, signals.h:  Signal-handling routines.

subserver.cc, subserver.h:  The client-connection portion of the
TCP-based server program.  Maintains an open connection to the main
server and to each client.  TODO: whatever has not already been moved
to classes/stream.cc needs to be moved, and these files deleted.
