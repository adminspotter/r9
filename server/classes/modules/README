This directory contains the database routines, the server console port
code, and routines for embedding other languages into the server (probably
for use with the console).

The database structure is reasonably normal-formed.  One thing we might
consider is having a separate database routine server, so that we can
both enforce proper use of the database, and perform adequate checking
for who's actually supposed to be using this thing.

TODO:  Since we supply the database type in our config structure, we
will be making each of the database types a separate library with
built-in registration functions for the common operations, so that we
can dynamically change our database type.
