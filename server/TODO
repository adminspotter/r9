In no particular order:

1)  Get the basic protocol elements implemented:  action requests, motion
    updates.
2)  Implement the new concept for logging in - login happens, then the
    user uses the "control character" skill (which everybody has) to gain
    access to the desired character.
3)  Collision detection?  No idea where to start on that.
4)  Work on getting server neighbors and server notification protocol
    activity worked out.
5)  Start using sectors in the zone again.  They were removed because
    they were awfully complicated, and were just confusing some of the
    simple stuff we were trying to do.  This is possibly required before
    collision detection will work the way we want.
6)  Figure out who can see what, and only send position updates on visible
    objects.  Again, sectors might be required before this will happen.
7)  Define and implement more actions/skills.
8)  Read the geometry files, and add positional and bounding data to them.
    Maybe use straight XML for them?  Writing SAX parsers isn't all that
    demanding.
9)  See about making the octrees (part of the sector) dynamic, since they
    will only have bounding volumes in them, and things will move around
    (of course).
10) Figure out how we want to do landscape.  That might be a way off,
    since we'll be starting with space, but it's going to come up.
11) Rework the basic server skeleton so that each listening port is handled
    in a thread, and does all its own user management in that thread.
