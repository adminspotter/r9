R9 was born out out two groups that were talking about making games,
starting in early 1998.  They didn't know about each other, and their
two visions weren't quite compatible with each other, but the engine
was flexible enough to move from one to the other without a huge
amount of rework.

The start of the server was meant to be a multi-game server, with each
game controlled by its own loaded library.  Ringleaders for that
discussion were Richard Finn, Damon Courtney, and Andy Doerr.

In 1999 or 2000, a different group started talking about more of an
MMO-type game.  The existing server program (then just called
"server") was flexible enough to handle the transition, and just
started moving in the new direction.  David Pitre was the source of
the name, as the ideas for game mechanics were based on his ninth
revision of game rules that he'd been working on.  Additional
conspirators were Reverend Phil and Shane Brauner.
