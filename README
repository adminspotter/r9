Revision IX (revision9, r9, etc.) is a server engine which manages 3D
space.  It is intended to be distributed and modular; servers will know
about their neighbors, and actors should be seamlessly handed off between
neighboring servers as necessary.  Each server can have different modules
which govern the physics engine and allowable skills.  Objects contained
within a server are also modular, and will be dynamically-loaded by
clients.
